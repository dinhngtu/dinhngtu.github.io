In September 2017, more than 2 million users were exposed to malware embedded in CCleaner, a commonly-used PC cleanup utility; the malware was later revealed to be designed to target and infiltrate large tech companies, with Samsung, Sony, VMWare, Intel and others in its list of targets. In 2016, the Transmission torrent app for OS X was hacked not once, but twice in order to spread ransomware. In March 2012, security experts found out that the extremely popular Vietnamese keyboard software when downloaded from its official website has contained a malicious trojan for multiple months.</p>
<p>While the motives of these attacks might be different, their methods are in common: they all involved the use of popular software infected with malicious code. IT security experts have a fancy name for this kind of attack: the <em>supply chain attack</em>.</p>
<p>In this article, we take a deeper look into supply chain attacks and their prevalence, as well as some ways to stay alert and protected against these attacks.</p>
</div></section><section><div><h1>Anatomy of a supply chain attack</h1>
<p>Most attacks of this category begin from a compromised resource, e.g. a software delivery server or a cloud service account. The compromised resource then acts as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_hole_attack">watering hole</a> to further spread malware to unsuspecting users, by delivering infected software to its users or by directly infecting users through the use of software vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Unlike a targeted attack on a particular system, supply chain attacks often have a wide audience, including both corporate and personal systems from multiple organizations and countries, creating a virtual dragnet that lets attackers gain access to multiple victims at once. From there, they can directly exfiltrate information and use them as tools for further compromise of the victim’s infrastructure.</p>
</div></section><section><div><h1>Increasing prevalence and impact</h1>
<p>Supply chain attacks are extremely effective thanks to a lower barrier to entry and ease of wide deployment. Since end user machines often do not get the same attention as servers, and often lack important security measures like application control and monitoring, these attacks are growing into ever more attractive tools for attackers to gain a foothold in your systems.</p>
<p>This is proven by the fact that in recent years, supply chain attacks have been becoming increasingly common and devastating. Symantec cited a 200% increase in software update-related attacks in 2017 alone; these attacks have claimed millions of victims and hundreds of millions in damage, with the CCleaner hack and NotPetya as prime examples in scale and deadliness.</p>
<p>Worryingly, supply chain attacks are not a recent phenomenon. In 2012, Gartner warned of supply chain attacks as an increasing trend that “will be identified as a top three security-related concern” by 2017. Yet, as is evident from the recent spate of high-profile attacks, many companies are still not ready to deal with supply chain threats. Therefore, we can only imagine that these attacks will only become more common in the future.</p>
</div></section><section><div><h1>Mitigating supply chain attacks</h1>
<p>As with many other categories of vulnerabilities, there exists no silver bullet that can provide complete security. Instead, supply chain attacks require holistic, in-depth and properly executed security controls, which is often difficult for smaller firms with little IT expertise. However, there are several ways businesses can use to protect themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the software footprint of your system. Eliminate software that is uncommon, unnecessary or poorly maintained. If you are not sure if you need software X or not, chances are that you don’t need it.<ul>
<li>The higher the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/securing-privileged-access-reference-material#ADATM_BM">administrative tier</a> of your server, the more careful you should think before introducing new software. Exercise extreme caution when installing software into e.g. domain controllers. Needless to say, that doesn’t mean you can install whatever you want into end user machines with abandon; ransomware has proven quite well that even unprivileged machines can deal plenty of damage to your business.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exercise application control. Application whitelisting solutions like AppLocker and Device Guard are among the most powerful defenses against malware if used correctly. While these solutions can be difficult to implement, a good starting point is to implement them on high-value machines such as domain controllers and servers running sensitive applications.</li>
<li>Ensure software integrity. Use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/securing-privileged-access-reference-material#CSP_BM">clean source principle</a> when installing or updating servers. Be wary of self-updating software; poorly-implemented update verification is a common source of infection (see CCleaner). Digital signatures can help with integrity checking; unfortunately, attacks utilizing stolen code-signing certificates are very common. When in doubt, don’t install the software (see point 1).</li>
<li>Isolate different applications and environments whenever possible to prevent lateral movement and privilege escalation.<ul>
<li>Use network and device controls to keep attackers out of your sensitive systems.</li>
<li>Implement <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/securing-privileged-access">secured privileged access</a> to harden your administrative infrastructure and procedures.</li>
<li>Solutions like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/wd-app-guard-overview">Windows Defender Application Guard</a> can protect users by isolating their non-work related activities from the rest of the system instead of blocking these activities outright.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use application inventory and security monitoring. They can help you identify deficiencies in your security policies, and give you an early warning in case of a possible breach.</li>
<li>Keep your software updated and protected. Most modern AV solutions no longer depend on fixed signatures, and can intelligently analyze and detect new threats in real time. Use intrusion prevention features (e.g. Windows Defender Credential Guard, Windows Defender Exploit Guard, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>These mitigation approaches make supply chain attacks substantially more difficult by closing off venues of infiltration available to the attacker. In addition, they also serve as good security practices that will prove useful beyond supply chain attacks.</p>
